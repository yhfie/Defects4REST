# Defects4REST Version 1.0.0

A comprehensive benchmark and bug mining framework for systematically deploying, testing, and analyzing reproducible real-world bugs in REST API applications.
The benchmark includes 110 defects across 12 real-world open-source projects along with deployment scripts, replication steps, and detailed metadata.

## Features

- **Single-command Deployment** — Instantly deploy either the buggy or the patched version of the system.
- **Pre-configured, Bug-specific Environments** — For each bug, the benchmark initializes the setup required to reproduce it, such as admin accounts, API tokens, test data, or other necessary configuration when applicable.
- **Step-by-Step Guides** — Detailed, Bug-specific replication steps provided for all 110 bugs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

#### Linux / macOS:
- Python 3.9+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Go 1.16+

#### Windows
- Python 3.9+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Go 1.16+
- WSL2 installed with Ubuntu
- Docker Desktop with WSL integration enabled

#### Project-Specific System Requirements (Podman)
> **Note:** The following requirements apply only when replicating defects from
> the **Podman** subject.
- Linux environment:
  - Native Linux
  - Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
  - Linux virtual machine on macOS (e.g., Podman machine)
- `sudo` privileges
- System packages:
```bash
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y conmon btrfs-progs gcc git golang-go go-md2man iptables libassuan-dev libbtrfs-dev libc6-dev libdevmapper-dev libglib2.0-dev libgpgme-dev libgpg-error-dev libprotobuf-dev libprotobuf-c-dev libseccomp-dev libselinux1-dev libsystemd-dev make netavark passt pkg-config runc uidmap
````

### Install from Source

> **Recommended:** Create a new Python virtual environment before installing.

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv defects4rest-env
source defects4rest-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: defects4rest-env\Scripts\activate

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ANSWER-OSU/Defects4REST.git
cd Defects4REST

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Verify installation
defects4rest --help
```

Once installed, you can run `defects4rest` from any directory as long as the virtual environment is activated.

### Updating to Latest Version

If you have an older version installed, pull the latest changes and reinstall:

```bash
cd Defects4REST
git pull
pip install -e .
```

> **Note:** Just pulling the repository won't update the installed package, you must rerun `pip install -e .` again to install the cloned version.

## Usage

The CLI provides two commands: `info` to view bug details and `checkout` to deploy environments.

```bash
# View bug details
defects4rest info -p <project> -i <issue>

# Deploy buggy version
defects4rest checkout -p <project> -i <issue> --buggy

# Deploy patched version
defects4rest checkout -p <project> -i <issue> --patched

# Cleanup
defects4rest checkout -p <project> -i <issue> --clean

# Clone and checkout only (buggy version)
defects4rest checkout -p <project> -i <issue> --buggy --no-deploy

# Clone and checkout only (patched version)
defects4rest checkout -p <project> -i <issue> --patched --no-deploy
```

See detailed documentation: [info](./docs/commands/info.md) | [checkout](./docs/commands/checkout.md)

## OpenAPI Specifications

For each bug, the OpenAPI specifications are available at:

```
bug_replication/<project>/<project>#<issue>/<project>#<issue>_spec.json/yaml
```
